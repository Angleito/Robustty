# Streaming Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve Discord voice streaming errors and HLS connection issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. FFmpeg HLS Connection Errors
**Problem**: FFmpeg was experiencing keepalive failures and connection issues with Google's video servers:
```
[hls @ 0xaaaae0cdb4e0] keepalive request failed for 'https://rr3---sn-bvvbaxivnuxqjvm-a5nl.googlevideo.com/...'
Cannot reuse HTTP connection for different host
```

**Solution**: Enhanced FFmpeg options with better connection handling:
- Disabled HTTP persistent connections (`-http_persistent 0`)
- Added proper user agent and headers
- Increased read/write timeout (`-rw_timeout 30000000`)
- Added multiple request support (`-multiple_requests 1`)
- Enhanced reconnection parameters

### 2. Discord Voice Connection Drops
**Problem**: Frequent WebSocket disconnections with error code 1006:
```
discord.errors.ConnectionClosed: Shard ID None WebSocket closed with 1006
```

**Solution**: Implemented robust reconnection system:
- Automatic connection monitoring with 30-second health checks
- Exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Voice client validation before playback attempts
- Graceful handling of connection failures

### 3. Stream URL Quality and Stability
**Problem**: HLS streams were less stable than direct MP4 URLs for audio playback.

**Solution**: Intelligent format selection:
- Prefer direct audio formats over HLS/DASH when available
- Separate audio-only from video formats
- Quality-based sorting while prioritizing stability
- Fallback mechanisms for different format types

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Audio Player (`src/services/audio_player.py`)
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff for failed playbacks
- **Stream Validation**: Pre-playback URL validation using aiohttp
- **Connection Monitoring**: Integration with connection health tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fresh URL retrieval on failures

### Connection Monitor (`src/services/connection_monitor.py`)
- **Voice Connection Monitoring**: Automatic detection of disconnected clients
- **Reconnection Logic**: Smart reconnection with attempt limits
- **Stream Health Tracking**: URL failure tracking and blacklisting
- **Performance Metrics**: Health statistics and monitoring

### YouTube Platform Improvements (`src/platforms/youtube.py`)
- **Format Preference**: Direct URLs prioritized over HLS streams
- **Quality Selection**: Better audio format selection with bitrate sorting
- **Cookie Integration**: Enhanced cookie conversion and validation
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and debugging

### Music Cog Enhancements (`src/bot/cogs/music.py`)
- **Robust Connection**: Enhanced join command with retry logic
- **Connection Validation**: Health checks before attempting operations
- **Audio Player Integration**: Proper voice client management
- **Error Feedback**: Better user feedback on connection issues

## Configuration Changes

### FFmpeg Options
```python
ffmpeg_options = {
    "before_options": (
        "-reconnect 1 "
        "-reconnect_streamed 1 "
        "-reconnect_delay_max 5 "
        "-reconnect_at_eof 1 "
        "-multiple_requests 1 "
        "-http_persistent 0 "
        "-user_agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36' "
        "-headers 'Accept: */*' "
        "-rw_timeout 30000000 "
        "-loglevel warning"
    ),
    "options": "-vn -ar 48000 -ac 2 -b:a 128k -bufsize 512k -maxrate 256k",
}
```

### Connection Monitoring
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Maximum 5 reconnection attempts per guild
- Exponential backoff: 2^attempt seconds
- Automatic audio player integration

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced Connection Drops**: Automatic reconnection handles most voice disconnects
2. **Better Stream Stability**: Direct URLs preferred over HLS when possible
3. **Faster Recovery**: Quick detection and resolution of connection issues
4. **Improved User Experience**: Less interruption and better error handling
5. **Enhanced Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for failed streams

## Testing

The `test_streaming_fixes.py` script validates:
- Stream health monitoring functionality
- YouTube platform improvements
- Audio player enhancements
- FFmpeg option validation

## Monitoring

Check the following logs to monitor improvements:
- Connection monitor logs: `Connection monitoring started/stopped`
- Reconnection attempts: `Attempting to reconnect to {channel}`
- Stream health: `Stream URL marked as unhealthy`
- Format selection: `Selected direct/HLS audio format`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Quality**: Dynamic quality adjustment based on connection stability
2. **Caching**: Stream URL caching with TTL for better performance
3. **Analytics**: Detailed metrics on connection success rates
4. **User Notifications**: Optional notifications for connection events
5. **Platform Expansion**: Apply similar improvements to other platforms

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check FFmpeg installation and version
2. Verify Discord bot permissions in voice channels
3. Monitor connection monitor logs for patterns
4. Check stream health statistics
5. Validate YouTube cookie extraction is working

This comprehensive approach should significantly reduce the streaming errors and provide a much more stable audio experience.
